## fledge - Introduction

The goal of _fledge_ is to streamline the process of versioning R packages and updating the `NEWS.md` file. It applies to R packages that are being version controlled on GitHub.  
 By incorporating a few simple and easy steps during the development process, you can ensure that versioning and updating of `NEWS.md` and `DESCRIPTION` is easily achieved for release.


## Installation
_Fledge_ can be installed from GitHub using the command

 ```
 remotes::install_github("krlmlr/fledge")
 ```
 
## Why use fledge 
Without _fledge_ you probably follow these steps at different stages of your workflow.

1. Check the previous version used, before assigning a new version number.
2. Check the previous commit messages to decide what should go in the `NEWS.md` file.
3. Manually merge the `NEWS.md` files from different branches after reviewing the discrepancies.

_Fledge_ provides standardised version number updates to your package. It can also read your commit messages from recent commits and include the marked lines in `NEWS.md`. As the `NEWS.md` is generated by _fledge_, there is no need to merge it manually.  All of this can be achieved with just one function call.

Using _fledge_ would not only save you time, but will also streamline the process of versioning and updating `NEWS.md`.


## Functions

_Fledge_ consists of the following functions that enable versioning at different stages through the package development lifecycle.

Function Name | Description|Stage Applicable
--------------|----------------|------------
bump_version(which)|Increments the package version based on argument. (Version format supported _major.minor.dev.patch_) |Configuration, Development, Release
finalize_version()|Finalize the package version|Configuration, Development
commit_version()|Commits `NEWS.md` and `DESCRIPTION` to Git.| Release
tag_version|Parses `NEWS.md` and creates/updates the tag for the most recent version.|Release
update_news()|Update `NEWS.md` with messages from top level commits|Used by bump_version()
update_version()|Update `NEWS.md` and `DESCRIPTION` with a new version|Used by bump_version()

## Usage

The following sections show, how to combine these functions at different stages with any R package on GitHub.  
All _fledge_ commands should be issued from the package directory of the target R package.

#### Initial Configuration

_Fledge_ assumes that the target R package is version-controlled with Git in a dedicated repository.  
The following steps are required to set up _fledge_ for first time use, with your package.  

1. Call `bump_version()` as given below to set the package version   
 
    ```
    fledge::bump_version()
    ```
 
2. Call `finalize_version()` as given below to update `NEWS.md`  
 
    ```
    fledge::finalize_version()
    ```
 
You are all set to switch to the development stage now. Ensure that you use bullet points (`*` or `-`) in your commit or merge messages to indicate the messages that you want to include in `NEWS.md`


#### Development

_Fledge_ aims to update `NEWS.md` and `DESCRIPTION` correctly whenever a new version is assigned. In order to do this, the following steps need to be included through out the development workflow.

1. In commit messages to master, mark everything that should go to `NEWS.md` with a bullet point (`-` or `*`). This is applicable to single commits, merge commits, or pull requests.

2. When you want to assign a version number to the current state of your R package, call

    ```
    fledge::bump_version()
    ```  
 The default argument for bump_version is "dev". So the dev part of the version number will be updated.

3. Edit `NEWS.md` if required. Then call `finalize_version()` as below.

    ```
    fledge::finalize_version()
    ```  
 This achieves the following
 
 * `NEWS.md` is now composed, based on the most recent commit messages. This will help to avoid merge conflicts in `NEWS.md`. To understand how `NEWS.md` is updated by fledge, see the section on NEWS.md implementation.
 * A new version number is assigned automatically (this is modeled after `[usethis::use_version()][use_version_url]`)
 * A tag matching the version number is assigned automatically, with the most recent `NEWS.md` messages included in the tag's message.

#### Releasing to CRAN
When you want to release your package to CRAN, follow the below steps

1. Call bump_version() with the appropriate argument ("**patch**", "**major**", "**minor**"). eg.,

    ```
    fledge::bump_version(" patch")
    ```
2. Edit `NEWS.md`, convert the changelog to a higher-level description of features and bug fixes.

3. Call commit_version() as below

     ```
    fledge::commit_version()
     ```

4. Make any necessary adjustments before releasing to CRAN.

5. Once the release/changes have been accepted by CRAN, use the following calls, to tag the released version and to switch to a development version immediately.

    ```
    fledge::tag_version(force = TRUE)
    fledge::bump_version()
    ```

## Implementation
The following sections explain, how things actually work inside fledge

#### NEWS.md Update
New entries are added to `NEWS.md` from commit messages to commits in `master`.
 
* Only top-level commits are considered (roughly equivalent to `git log --first-parent`.) The messages from these commits are parsed. Only lines that start with a star `*` or a dash `-` are included.
* If a line starts with three dashes, then everything past that line is excluded.
 For eg., the following commit message

    ```
    Merge f-fancy-feature to master, closes #5678

    - Added fancy feature (#5678).

    - Fixed bug as a side effect (#9012).

    ---

    The fancy feature consists of the components:

    - foo
    - bar
    - baz
    ```
will be added as below to `NEWS.md`

    ```
    - Added fancy feature (#5678).
    - Fixed bug as a side effect (#9012).
    ```
When retrieving the current NEWS for defining the tag message, the entries between the first two first-level headers (starting with `#`) are returned. You can use second and third level headers and add as many empty lines as you want.

#### bump_version()
The first function to call at any stage is always `bump_version()`. This does the following

1. Calls `update_news()` to collect NEWS entries from top-level commits.

2. Calls `update_version()` to increment the version in DESCRIPTION and add a header to NEWS.md.

#### "dev" Vs other releases
After calling `bump_version()` the respective functions can be called depending on the release type, as given below
   
*  "`dev`" releases: Call `finalize_version()` to  commit `DESCRIPTION` and `NEWS.md`. Also creates tag with a message.  
*  Other releases: Call `commit_version()` to commit `DESCRIPTION` and `NEWS.md`

You can always edit `NEWS.md` and call `finalize_version()` again. Both the commit and the tag will be updated.

## Caveats
If you rebase after creating a tag, you need to call `finalize_version()` to make sure the tag is moved to the mainline branch.  
If you pushed after calling `finalize_version()` (directly or indirectly), the tag may have been pushed as well. In this case, invoke
 
 ```
 git push origin :vx.y.z.9www
 ``` 
(where `x.y.z.9www` is the new version) to delete the newly created remote tag. Due to this, only "`dev`" releases are tagged automatically. Other releases always must be tagged manually with `tag_version()`.
